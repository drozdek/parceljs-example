### What's Parcel?
Parceljs is a great bundler. What makes one unique is performance and output bundle size which is smaller comparing to other competitors, eg: Webpack etc... 

It is served preconfigured, so all you need to do is to run it, and all your assets are bundled and server properly.

With the approach of v2 there's a small configuration - however comparing to other tools Parcel definitely wins. You are not becoming overwhelmed with the amount of settings, values to be set, changing already existing keys, values what maked work with the tool more enjoyable.
